Technical requirements
To ensure a smooth learning experience throughout this book, it's essential to have the necessary technologies and installations set up. This section outlines the technical requirements for working with Python and relevant libraries.
All technical requirement related to this chapter are shared in the book’s GitHub URL below under ch06 folder: https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Options-Trading-with-Python-/tree/main/ch6

The installation of Python, Anaconda, integrated development environments (IDEs), and package managers, as well as the creation of the mboptions environment, has already been covered in detail in Chapter 4. 
You can install all the book necessary packages listed in the requirement file opprequirements.txt from Chapter 4, or you can limit yourself to installing the libraries used in this chapter details below.
Libraries needed for this chapter
Once Python and pip are set up, you'll need to install the libraries needed for this chapter if not installed yet.
The libraries versions installed for this chapter along with Python version 3.12.6   are as follow:
•	pandas 2.2.2
•	pytz 2024.2
•	numpy 1.26.4
•	matplotlib 3.9.2
•	scipy 1.14.1
•	python-dateutil 2.9.0.post0
•	networkx 3.3
To install the necessary libraries for your Python script, you will need to use either pip or conda. The installation process was covered in detail in Chapter 4. Our Python code is compatible with older versions of Python 3 and its libraries; however, I recommend using the same version to avoid any surprises.
Loading needed Libraries and modules
For this chapter, we'll initiate our Python code by first importing the necessary libraries and modules, as outlined below:
# import Lib
import pandas as pd
import datetime as dt
import pytz
import os
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
import scipy.stats as si
import math
import networkx as nx
# import module
from datetime import datetime, timezone
from datetime import date, time
from math import trunc
from dateutil.parser import parse

Important note
NetworkX is a Python library used for the creation, manipulation, and study of complex networks (graphs). It provides tools to work with both undirected and directed graphs and supports various graph algorithms.
With these technical requirements in place, you're now ready to dive into the world of options pricing with binomial and trinomial trees using Python. As you progress through the book, you'll gain hands-on experience and practical skills by working with these powerful tools and libraries.
